# Landscape

**Dated 2026-09-01.** Adjacent tools will keep shipping. Re-check citations before treating this as current. Previous snapshot: 2026-08-15.

This document exists so we do not claim false whitespace.

## The claim we make

No shipping product takes production traces, reconstructs the agent graph, and recommends *determinism-class* refactors (tool ↔ LLM ↔ subagent) backed by counterfactual evidence.

Differentiation:

> Counterfactual *re-typing* of nodes between deterministic tools and stochastic LLM/subagents, on ingested production graphs — not “score the path you already ran,” and not “search a new workflow from scratch.”

## Claims we will not make

Do **not** say “nobody does counterfactual agent simulation.” CAR, CausalFlow, Tracefork, AgentReplay, and counterfact already intervene on traces.

Do **not** say “nobody does agent architecture search.” MaAS, AFlow, ScoreFlow, ADAS, EvoAgentX exist. They search operator graphs offline; they do not ingest a production graph and flip tool vs LLM.

Do **not** say “nobody lints agent architecture.” AgentLint, isolint, ArchRails, and arch-advisor lint harness files or interview the user. They do not simulate flips on traces.

Do **not** say “nobody advises tool vs LLM.” WHEN2TOOL, MeCo, and “To Call or Not to Call” decide *at generation time* whether to emit a tool call. Galileo Tool Selection Quality scores a turn. None output “refactor node X from `invoke_agent` to `execute_tool`.”

## Closest neighbors

**Causal Agent Replay (CAR)** — [arXiv:2606.08275](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.08275), [jaineet17/causal-agent-replay](https://github.com/jaineet17/causal-agent-replay). Models a run as an SCM. `do_policy` is the flip we want, but CAR attributes *failure*, it does not recommend “make this node a tool.” Closest research system on the simulation axis.

**CausalFlow** — [arXiv:2605.25338](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.25338). Typed steps (`REASONING`, `TOOL_CALL`, `LLM_RESPONSE`, …). Repairs step *content*, not node type. The type tags are a natural hook.

**Tracefork** / **AgentReplay** — content-addressed tape / VCR cassette. The L0/L1 engine we would want under a flip simulator. They do not search architectures.

**counterfact** — [counterfact-labs/counterfact](https://github.com/counterfact-labs/counterfact). Ablates agents, Shapley attribution, fix recommendations. Closest product-shaped OSS on “recommend a change.” Wrong intervention: remove/degrade a node, do not re-type it.

**WHEN2TOOL** — [arXiv:2605.09252](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.09252). Necessity is decodable from hidden states. Runtime policy, not architecture advice.

**Progressive Crystallization** — [arXiv:2607.07052](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.07052) (2026-07-08). Promotes repeated traces from stochastic to hybrid to deterministic playbooks in production AIOps. Narrows whitespace: we do **not** claim “trace-driven determinization.” We claim counterfactual *node re-typing* with intervals on an ingested graph, plus ABSTAIN/canary — not automatic promotion.

**RouteGuard** — [arXiv:2608.07583](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.07583) (2026-08-05). Certifies routing gain; refuses when the gain sits in a few workload cells. Adopt cluster-aware confidence; ABSTAIN when the apparent flip depends on a thin stratum.

**FlowScout** — [arXiv:2608.10039](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.10039) (2026-08-10). Searches mixed LLM/tool graphs from history (MCTS). Close prior art that **searches a new workflow**, not a determinism-class intervention on the ingested graph.

**SymTrace** — [arXiv:2608.25920](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.25920) (2026-08-26). Prefix replay vs unguided resample. Reports must expose anchors and replay-vs-resample.

**GCJR** — [arXiv:2608.29228](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.29228) (2026-08-29). Minimal repair *families* (AND vs OR). Graph-guided replay is not novel; set-valued candidates after singleton correctness are in-scope as hypotheses, not unbounded search.

**Eval platforms** — LangSmith, MLflow, DeepEval Tool Correctness, Galileo Tool Selection Quality, Langfuse. Observe and score. DeepEval’s Tool Correctness is the closest *conceptual* split (deterministic tool check vs LLM-judged steps) and is still testing infrastructure.

## How to talk about this

Safe: “No product flips determinism class on an ingested production graph and recommends a refactor.”

Unsafe: “Nobody does counterfactual traces / architecture search / tool-correctness / when-to-use-an-agent advising / agent simulation.” Those phrases already belong to other products (and “simulation” often means *user* simulation).

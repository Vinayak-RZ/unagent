# Extensive README — pre-ship checklist

## Routing and file

- [ ] Wrote `docs/EXTENSIVE.md` (or the path the user named), **not** as a replacement for a product/readable `README.md`
- [ ] Main `README.md` has a top banner link here (added or already present)
- [ ] If the user wanted a product or readable main README, that was a different skill

## Coverage

- [ ] End-to-end "how this repository runs" with a diagram
- [ ] **Every first-party package** has its own section (or every top-level module in a single-package repo)
- [ ] Each package: what it is for, how it is used, how it works
- [ ] File map for important files: path, **why it exists**, what it does
- [ ] No "and other utilities" instead of a section
- [ ] Generated/vendor trees mentioned once, not file-listed

## Accuracy

- [ ] Every path exists in the tree
- [ ] Package list matches workspaces / folders
- [ ] No invented features or URLs

## Teaching and future

- [ ] Non-obvious ideas explained simply; hard ones link a verified blog or wiki
- [ ] Ideology and engineering bets are named (not only file maps)
- [ ] Future advancements: at least 3, prefer 4, grounded in this repo
